# Hands-on-with-MUnit-and-Pact

This repo is intended for the DevOps Playground Hands on with MUnit and Pact. During the DevOps Playground we provide a hosted infra that can be accessed by any web browser on your machine. You can find your instance on the day here: https://lab.devopsplayground.org/

Follow along with the presenter on the day, if you get stuck or fall behind, there are detailed steps below of what we will be doing. You can rewind or awatch back on YouTube if using your own machine at anytime. [LINK TO COME]

## Prerequisites (Your own machine)
This playground uses the following technology so you will need to make sure the following is setup on your machine:

1. Clone this Repo
1. Get an AnyPoint Studio Trial or Licence: https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/anypoint-mule-studio
1. Install Java: https://www.java.com/download/
1. Install Maven: https://maven.apache.org/install.html
1. Download Pact Standalone JVM: 
1. Eclipse (maybe, sometimes get an error about needing Eclipse installed for Windows): https://eclipseide.org/

## Explain the flow

TODO: dev specs

##Â Running a test

## Running the provider verification

## Fixing the contract verification 

## Writing more tests for each method


## Bonus || Running with the Pact Broker
To use the pact broker with this solution you will need to make a few small changes. 

The first change to make is to set the broker url. Navigate to the `./pact-munit-example/src/main/java/pact/PactService.java` file and locate the function `startPactService()`. Here we will add two lines of code after the port configuration to pass the broker URL. 

> You can run a [Pact Broker](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker) with [docker](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/docker_images), the [cli](https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/client_cli) or by using [PactFlow](https://docs.pact.io/pact_nirvana). See here for detailed documentation on how to setup the broker: 

```Java
public static Process startPactService() throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        String command = "sh " 
			+ System.getProperty("user.dir") 
			+ "/pact-jvm-server-4.1.42/bin/pact-jvm-server "
            + pactServicePort
            + " -l "
            + mockPactServerPort
            + " -u "
            + mockPactServerPort
            + " -b "
            + brokerUrl
            + " -v 3";
		
        pactService = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command);
		printServiceResponse();

        return pactService;
    }
```

This will now no longer save pact files locally but instead hold them in memory until the `/publish` endpoint is hit to send the files up to the broker. 

With this we will now need to write an API call to the `/publish` endpoint of the Pact Server. This should be run either after the "Write Pact File" code block or in the "After Test" stage. 

In the file `pact-munit-example/src/main/java/pact/PactMockServer.java` add the following function to the `PactMockServer` class.

```Java
public static void publishPactFile(String pactArgs) throws ClientProtocolException {
			client = HttpClients.createDefault();
			HttpPost post = new HttpPost("http://localhost:" + pactServicePort + "/publish");
			JSONObject pactSetup = new JSONObject(pactArgs);
			JSONObject requestBody = new JSONObject();
			ResponseHandler<String> handler = new BasicResponseHandler();
	
			requestBody.put("consumer", (String) pactSetup.get("consumer"));
			requestBody.put("consumerVersion", (String) pactSetup.get("consumerVersion"));
			requestBody.put("provider", (String) pactSetup.get("provider"));
			
			post.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
			
			try {
				post.setEntity(new StringEntity(requestBody.toString()));
				String body = client.execute(post, handler);
				System.out.println("Request Pact Body: " + body);
			    	    
			    close();
			} catch (IOException e) {
				System.out.println(e.getMessage());
			}	    
	}
```
